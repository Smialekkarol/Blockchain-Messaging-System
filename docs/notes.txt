# blockchain protocol

Node
-Should encrypt data on send to node
-Should decrypt data received from node
-Should have buffer which handles receive and send of big data
-Should have mehchanism to retry on failure.
-Should have broadcast mechanism to propagate new block to other nodes
-Should have consensus mechanism to resolve which of the block is the newest
-Should handle consistency of messages. For instance should handle order of send and received messages.
-Should have buffer for messages
-Should have endpoint to create new blockhain

-Consensus mechanism is based on timestamp
-Consensus mechanism should come to consensus by communicating with multiple validators
-We do not override past after confiration of validation
-All nodes handling given blockchain in given time stamp must validate each other
-Nodes choose randomly one validator between each other. Sends to him all data. The chosen validator sorts entries by timestamp.
After sorting it boradcast data to connected nodes.
After broadcasting to nodes in given blockchain. The blockchain is propagated to ohter nodes in protocol.

Gateway
-Is used only by the client. Nodes communicates direcetly between each other
-Should encrypt data on send to node
-Should decrypt data received from node
-Should have buffer which handles receive and send of big data
-Should have mehchanism to retry on failure on timeout. For instance retry 3 times then propagate error.
-Should forward error to client
-Should have buffer for messages
